# Pimax Game Manager

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/SFXShannon/pimax-game-manager/total?label=downloads)](https://github.com/SFXShannon/pimax-game-manager/releases) [![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/SFXShannon/pimax-game-manager?label=latest)](https://github.com/SFXShannon/pimax-game-manager/releases/latest) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/SFXShannon/pimax-game-manager)](LICENSE)

A Windows tool for managing your **Pimax Play** library: add games (one at a time or a whole folder), set custom cover images, arrange the library in any order, edit per-game settings for many games at once, and back it all up so a Pimax update can't wipe your changes.

*Formerly Pimax Cover Changer.*

## Download

Get **`PimaxGameManagerSetup.exe`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/SFXShannon/pimax-game-manager/releases/latest) and run it. It installs to your user folder (no admin needed to install), adds a Start menu shortcut, and asks whether you want a desktop shortcut (ticked by default). To update, run the newer setup over the top. Uninstall from Windows **Settings > Apps**; your backups and settings are kept.

Prefer no install? Download **`PimaxGameManager.exe`** from the same page and run it from anywhere.

The app asks for admin rights when it starts, because it restarts the Pimax service so your changes take effect.

Windows SmartScreen or Defender may warn about it as an unrecognized app. If you'd rather not run the exe, run the script instead (see below). It's the same code.

## First-launch tour

The first time you open the app, a short tour walks through images, adding games, library order, game settings and backups. Use **Next** / **Back** (or the arrow keys) to step through it.

![Tour](screenshots/tutorial-v1.6.0.png)

Tick **Don't show this at startup** to stop it opening each time. You can open it again whenever you like with **Tutorial** at the bottom of the main window.

## Add games

**Add games...** puts games into your Pimax Play library without using Pimax's **Import** button. It creates exactly the same kind of entry Import does, so Pimax treats them as imported games.

![Add games](screenshots/add-games-v1.7.0.png)

- **Add .exe or shortcut...** picks one or more game .exe files or shortcuts (.lnk), for example a mod's launcher shortcut.
- **Scan a folder...** finds the main .exe of every game in a folder: a Steam library (such as `D:\SteamLibrary`), a folder of games, or one game's own folder. It skips uninstallers, crash reporters, servers, redistributables and the like.
- Each row shows the name Pimax will display (edit it if you like) and the program Pimax will start. If the scan picked the wrong .exe, choose another from the dropdown.
- Games already in your library are unticked and marked **Already in your library**, so nothing is added twice.
- **Find a cover image for each game automatically** uses Steam's banner for games in a Steam library, otherwise an exact Steam store match, otherwise SteamGridDB (with a key). Games without a match can be given an image afterwards with **Find image**.
- **Add games** adds everything ticked and restarts Pimax Play once.

SteamVR games already show up in Pimax by themselves. Adding one here as well gives you a second entry that you *can* give your own image.

### Edit or remove an imported game

Pick an imported game and click **Edit / remove...** to:

- **Rename** it.
- **Change the program** it starts, for example to point it at a mod's .exe or launcher.
- **Remove from library**. The game itself isn't touched; only its Pimax Play entry is removed, and it's taken off your pinned list. The entry is kept in `%APPDATA%\PimaxGameManager\backups\removed-games`. Edits keep a copy of the old entry in `backups\edited-games`.

Steam and Oculus entries can't be edited or removed here, because Pimax rebuilds them from those stores.

## Library images

Custom images work for imported games (added with **Add games** or Pimax's **Import**). For SteamVR and Oculus games, Pimax copies the image from Steam or Oculus every time it starts, so any change is overwritten within seconds; the app shows the current image but won't let you change it. To give a Steam or Oculus game your own image, add its .exe with **Add games** and give that entry an image.

1. Pick an imported game from your Pimax library on the left.
2. Click **Find image** to search for art automatically, or paste an image link, or click **Browse...** for an image file.
3. Click **Apply image**. The tool saves the image, updates the game's entry, and restarts Pimax Play.

Wide banner images (about 460x215 or 920x430) fit Pimax tiles best.

- **Restore original** puts a game back to its original image.
- **Restart Pimax Play** (top right) restarts Pimax without changing anything.

### Find image

**Find image** shows a gallery of matching art. Click one to use it.

![Find image](screenshots/find-image-v1.6.0.png)

- **Steam:** If the game is a Steam game, or an imported game whose .exe sits in a Steam library folder, the tool reads Steam's install records to get the exact game and shows its official banners. Otherwise it searches the Steam store by name. No account needed.
- **SteamGridDB (optional):** Adds many more choices, including community art and art for non-Steam games. Get a free API key by signing in at [steamgriddb.com](https://www.steamgriddb.com/), then **Preferences > API**. Paste it in with the **SteamGridDB key** button at the top right. The key is stored locally in `%APPDATA%\PimaxGameManager\settings.json`.

If the automatic match is wrong, type a different name in the search box and click **Search by name**.

## Library order

Pimax Play normally lists Steam games by Steam app ID, then Oculus games, then imported games in the order you added them. The only order it lets you set is for **pinned** games, which always come first. **Library order...** uses that to let you arrange the whole library:

![Library order](screenshots/library-order-v1.7.0.png)

- Tick games to pin them, and drag them into the order you want. While dragging, a label shows which game you're moving and a blue line shows where it will land; hold near the top or bottom edge of the list to scroll. **Move up / Move down** and **Move to top / Move to bottom** move the selected game without dragging.
- **Pin all** then drag to control the entire list. **Sort A-Z** sorts alphabetically.
- **Save and restart Pimax Play** writes the order and reopens Pimax Play.

The order is saved in Pimax Play's own pinned list (`pinToTopGameArray` in `%APPDATA%\PimaxClient\config.json`). Only that list is changed; the rest of the file is left exactly as it was, and a backup is made the first time. Games you add later appear below the pinned ones until you place them.

## Game settings

Pimax Play lets you give each game its own graphics settings, one game at a time. **Game settings...** shows them all in one place and lets you work across games:

![Game settings](screenshots/game-settings-v1.6.0.png)

- **Edit any game**, or the **Global** settings every game uses by default. Tick **Custom** on a setting to give a game its own value; unticked settings follow Global, which is shown next to each one.
- **Apply to...** on any setting copies just that setting to the games you pick. For example, turn on Smart Smoothing for all your sims in one go.
- **Copy all settings to...** gives other games exactly the same settings as the one you're viewing.
- **Reset to global** clears a game's custom settings so it follows Global again. On the Global entry it becomes **Reset to Pimax defaults**.
- **Save all changes** writes everything at once. Your edits are kept as you move between games (games with unsaved changes show in orange), and Apply to, Copy all and Reset are queued too, so Pimax only restarts once. **Undo this game** and **Discard all** throw edits away, and you're asked before closing with unsaved changes.
- **Remove leftover settings...** tidies up settings files for games no longer in your library (for example after re-importing a game, which gives it a new ID).

Settings covered: image quality and render resolution, overlay render factor, Quad View, FOV crop, center rendering, GPU upscaling (algorithm, ratio, sharpness), Smart Smoothing, lock to half refresh rate, and color tone. Games with their own settings are marked with `*` in the list. Advanced fine-tuning (custom Quad View and FOV values, color channels) is kept as-is and is still edited in Pimax Play.

Settings live in `%APPDATA%\Pimax\AppConfig` (`global.json` plus one file per game, named by the game's ID). Each file is backed up to `%APPDATA%\PimaxGameManager\backups\settings` before its first change.

## Backup & restore

Pimax updates sometimes reset library images, the library order, game settings or your headset setup. Pimax Game Manager keeps its own backups so you can put them back.

What's backed up:

- **Library images** for imported games
- **Library order**
- **Game settings**: global and per-game
- **Headset settings**: eye-tracking calibration, the headset profile (IPD, custom FOV crop, Quad View fine-tuning, audio switching) and the play area / boundary

![Backup & restore](screenshots/backup-restore-v1.6.0.png)

- **Automatic backups:** every time you apply an image, save the library order or save game settings, and each time you open the app, a backup is saved (only when something changed). The newest 20 automatic backups are kept; ones you make with **Back up now** are kept until you delete them.
- **Reset detection:** when the app opens it compares Pimax with your latest backup. If images, the order, settings files or headset files (such as the eye-tracking calibration) have gone missing, an orange bar offers to **Restore** them.
- **Restore:** in **Backup & restore...**, pick a backup and choose what to restore: library images, library order, game settings, headset settings, or any mix. Restoring headset settings briefly restarts the Pimax headset software (take the headset off first); it comes back on its own. Your current state is backed up first, so a restore can be undone. Games that were removed and imported again get a new ID in Pimax; they are matched by their .exe path.
- **Delete:** select one or more backups (Ctrl-click or Shift-click for several) and click **Delete selected**.

Backups are stored in %APPDATA%\PimaxGameManager\snapshots, outside Pimax's folders. Each one is a folder with the images, the settings files and a snapshot.json describing the library order and which image goes with which game.

## Updates

When the app opens, it checks this repo for a newer release in the background. If there is one, a bar at the top offers **Update now**. Click it and the app:

1. downloads the new version from the GitHub release (progress shows in the bar),
2. checks the download (its size, GitHub's SHA-256 checksum when listed, and the version number inside the file),
3. closes, installs the update, and reopens by itself.

If you installed with `PimaxGameManagerSetup.exe`, the new setup runs silently into the same folder, keeping your shortcuts. If you use the plain `PimaxGameManager.exe`, that file is replaced where it is; the old one is only removed once the new one is in place. Nothing is ever downloaded or installed until you click **Update now**. Your backups, images and settings are not touched. Each update is logged in `%APPDATA%\PimaxGameManager\update.log`.

Running the `.ps1` script instead of the exe? The button says **Download** and opens the release page.

The bottom-right corner shows the app version and whether it's **Up to date**, has an **Update available** (click to show the update bar), or **Couldn't check** (for example when offline). Click it to check again.

*Updating in the app works from version 1.7.1 onward. If you have an older version, download 1.7.1 once from the [releases page](https://github.com/SFXShannon/pimax-game-manager/releases/latest).*

## How it works

Pimax Play keeps each library entry as a JSON file in `%APPDATA%\Pimax\manifest`. The tile image comes from the entry's `icon` field, which accepts a web link or a local file path. This tool:

- copies the chosen image to `%APPDATA%\PimaxGameManager\covers` so it keeps working offline, if the original moves, and if Pimax clears its own folder,
- backs up the original entry to `%APPDATA%\PimaxGameManager\backups` the first time you change it,
- adds games by writing a new entry file of the same form Pimax's Import makes (`"source":"pimax_import"`, a random `local.xxxxxxxx` ID, the game's name and the .exe or shortcut to start), and checks the .exe path so a game isn't added twice,
- writes files back as UTF-8 **without a BOM** (Pimax silently drops entries saved with one),
- restarts Pimax: it stops Pimax Play, the `PiServiceLauncher` service and `PiPlayService.exe` (which holds the library and settings in memory and survives a plain service restart), then starts them again. Game settings are written while Pimax is stopped so it can't overwrite them.

## Notes

- Custom images only work for imported games; Pimax rebuilds Steam and Oculus entries from those stores every time it starts.
- Tested with Pimax Play 2.x. A future Pimax update could change how this works.

## Run from the script

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\PimaxGameManager.ps1
```

## Build the exe yourself

```powershell
Install-Module ps2exe -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-ps2exe .\PimaxGameManager.ps1 .\PimaxGameManager.exe -iconFile .\PimaxGameManager.ico -noConsole -requireAdmin -STA -title "Pimax Game Manager" -version 1.7.1
```

To build the installer too, install [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and run:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" /DAppVersion=1.7.1 .\PimaxGameManager.iss
```

The app icon and `assets/logo.png` are generated from the logo shapes used in the app:

```powershell
powershell -STA -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Make-Icon.ps1
```
